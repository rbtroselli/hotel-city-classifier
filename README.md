# Hotel City Classifier

## Project Overview
In the modern era of digital travel planning, platforms like TripAdvisor play a pivotal role in providing travelers with insights and information about accommodations worldwide. This project focuses on leveraging web scraping techniques to extract valuable data from TripAdvisor, specifically targeting hotel information. By gathering data on hotels within a chosen city, this project aims to create a comprehensive database that can be applied to various analyses and studies.

## Project Objectives
- **Data Collection:** The primary objective of this project is to scrape data from TripAdvisor regarding hotels in a specific city. This includes information such as search results, hotel details, and user reviews.
- **Data Scraping Methodology:** Utilizing Selenium in Python, the project employs web scraping techniques to simulate human behavior and collect data from TripAdvisor's platform.
- **Data Enrichment:** In addition to basic hotel information, the project also aims to gather and analyze reviews, ratings, and other relevant attributes associated with each hotel.
- **Geocoding Integration:** A key component of the project involves geocoding the addresses of hotels using MapQuest's paid API, allowing for spatial analysis and characterization of city areas.

## Scope of Work
The scope of the project encompasses the following tasks:
- Developing web scraping scripts to extract data from TripAdvisor's platform.
- Collecting comprehensive data on hotels within a specified city, including search attributes, hotel details, and user reviews.
- Implementing techniques to mimic human behavior, such as random wait times, to avoid detection and ensure data integrity.
- Integrating geocoding functionality to enhance the dataset with geographical coordinates and enable spatial analysis.

## Significance of the Project
The project holds significance for various stakeholders, including researchers, urban planners, and tourism professionals. By providing access to detailed hotel data and geospatial information, the project enables insights into city areas based on hotel characteristics, amenities, and user reviews. This information can inform decision-making processes related to tourism development, urban planning, and hospitality industry strategies.

# Tables
Tables and fields definitions

### Missing values
All fields that can be empty are never null, as all null values have been replaced with 'NA' for varchar fields, -1 for int and float fields, 999 for coordinates fields.

### Tables IDs
All IDs are unique and are the primary key of the table. They are generated by hashing the URL of the hotel, and truncating the hash at the first 19 digits. This allows for a unique identifier of the hotel that is an integer, crucial for performance reasons. The ID is often used for join and for upsert operations, a string would be inappropriate for these operations, being way more expensive in terms of performance (memory usage, processing, time).
All the tables are indexed on the ID field, to speed up join and upsert operations.
The collision probability with the truncated hashed string is not zero, but extremely low in the context of this project.

### HOTEL
Table containing information about scraped hotels. All the info is taken from the hotel's page on the site, with the exception of the ID and the coordinates. The ID is a hash of the URL, as previously mentioned. The coordinates are retrieved from the Nominatim API, using the address of the hotel.

### Review
Table containing information about reviews of hotels. The ID is a hash of the URL of the review, as previously mentioned. The hotel ID is a foreign key to the HOTEL table.
Reviews are scraped from hotel page (each page loads 10 reviews). Reviews in all languages are scraped. Language indication is not present in the webpage itself, so it is detected by the language detection library langdetect. The response from the hotel is not always present, so the fields are often empty. 
Date of review is scraped as month and year. Precise date of the review is not present in the hotel page, but only in the page of the review itself, that has not been scraped due to the large number of reviews (= page loads needed).
User ID is also saved, being the hash of the user's profile URL. User info are stored in another table.

### HOTEL_MAPQUEST_LOCATION
Table containing information about the location of the hotel, as retrieved from the MapQuest API. This information is additional, added in a second moment after the scraping of the hotel page, needed because of the unreliability of the Nominatim API (around 20% of missing  coordinates). In case of ambiguous addresses, the MapQuest API returns more than one result, so the table can contain more than one row for the same hotel, ranked in order of probability of the match (RANK=0 being the most probable).
The ID is a hash of the HOTEL_ID concatenated to the result RANK. The hotel ID is a foreign key to the HOTEL table.
The admin area fields are the administrative areas of the location, from the most specific to the most general.
All the fields are what's returned in the JSON by the API, with the exception of the IDs. Documentation [here](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/address/get/).
